# 🏌️ NPC Golf Ball Collector Game  
Welcome to the **NPC Golf Ball Collector Game**, a 3D Unity project where an NPC dynamically collects golf balls on a course using AI-driven mechanics. The game implements varying difficulty levels with stamina management.


## 🎮 Features  
- **AI Behavior**: NPC utilizes a Behavior Tree mechanism for decision-making and task prioritization.  
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Seamless movement powered by Unity's `NavMeshAgent`, ensuring realistic pathfinding.


## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Behavior Tree Mechanism**: The NPC decides its actions—collecting, resting, or ending—based on stamina, ball locations, and the game state.  
   - For a deeper dive, check out my [Medium article on Behavior Trees](https://medium.com/@onurkiris05).  
2. **Navigation and Movement**:  
   - The NPC uses Unity's `NavMeshAgent` for dynamic pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.  
   - Smooth path transitions are optimized for responsive movement.


## 🛠️ Installation  
Open the project in Unity (Unity version 2021.3.5f1 or later).
